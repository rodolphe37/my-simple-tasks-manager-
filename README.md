# Tutorial Intro

---

## My Simple Task Manager

is a drag-and-drop task manager as well as a time tracker (not for a team, but for a single freelance developer for example)!

### This is a great little application when you are working alone on projects where you need to organize your tasks, as well as track the time you spend on a project to know the actual time you spent on it.

this application is not responsive on mobile (as it is an application for people working in front of a computer - developer like me for example - I did not find useful to do media queries)
