## <img  style =" float: left; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 22px " src="demo/backlog.svg" alt="drawing" height="30" width="25"/>My Simple Task Manager_V2.1.0

is a drag-and-drop task manager as well as a time tracker (not for a team, but for a single freelance developer for example)!

### :bookmark: This is a great little application when you are working alone on projects where you need to organize your tasks, as well as track the time you spend on a project to know the actual time you spent on it.

![alt text](demo/version2/firstViewDash.png "My Simple Tasks Manager")

***For the graphics, let's see it in more detail...***

---


**:heavy_exclamation_mark: Time spent on each task!**

![alt text](demo/version2/timeSpent.png "My Simple Tasks Manager")

---

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: Budgetary impact for each task!**

> - You have, first of all, the view on all notes written during the project.

### New Version (26 sept 2021 - ^V_2.1.0)

 ***Warning - You must have entered a project name in the application to export the data.***
> - The files are named "on the fly" with this value, so you won't have a file name if you haven't entered this value first!
---

**You have two options for exporting dashboard data:**
 >- pdf export is not perfect for my taste (the layout of generated pdf more exactly), but they do work. I'm working on an improved version of the pdf export functionality right now... as soon as I get a great solution I'll update the application.

---

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: You can download the pdf report!**

>**The first is exporting as a pdf (without the graphs and numbers that are part of it).**
>
> - By clicking on the pdf icon, the application will generate a file with the raw data.


![alt text](demo/version2/pdf-export.gif "My Simple Tasks Manager")

---

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: You can download the png report screenshot!**

> - The second one is the export in png (copy of the complete dashboard this time).

>***If you choose this export option there is one important thing to know...***
>
> because the png file is generated automatically with the scale of your window, if you use this option in full screen in very large screen, your image will be all crushed.

![alt text](demo/version2/png.gif "My Simple Tasks Manager")

---

>And this is a result:

<img  style =" margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 22px " src="demo/version2/report.png" alt="drawing" height="1600" width="600"/>
---

>You can resize your window like the animated gif below (with the graphs in large size if you want (by reducing the width of your window before clicking on the png button))


![alt text](demo/version2/png-reduced.gif "My Simple Tasks Manager")

---

>And this is a result:

<img  style =" margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 22px " src="demo/version2/reduced.png" alt="drawing" height="2250" width="400"/>
---


## END OF UPDATE Version
---

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: When you want to delete the Project name!**

>You have two choices, delete only the project name or reset all (Project name, timer & all cards)

![alt text](demo/delete.gif "My Simple Tasks Manager")

---

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: When you want to delete an task card!**

>You have one alert for confirm your wish to delete this card (with name card)

![alt text](demo/confirm-delete-card.gif "My Simple Tasks Manager")

---

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: When you Start the counter!**

>The elapsed seconds are sent to the localstorage in real time, if you close the window inadvertently without stopping the counter, the elapsed time is automatically saved in the localStorage, adding to the time already present (seconds)!

![alt text](demo/real-time-seconds.gif "My Simple Tasks Manager")

---

**:x:** this application is  not responsive on mobile :mobile_phone_off: (as it is an application for people working in front of a computer - developer like me for example - I did not find useful to do media queries for that).


***(The demo is fully functional, all infos are stocked in localStorage)***

- Infos:
  - An input field, at the top right, is made to enter the name of the project you are working on!
  - 1 day of work is equivalent to 8 hours (28800 seconds)! (the calculation of the days worked in proportion to the passed seconds  is made with this logic - each 28800 elapsed seconds increment one day more)
  - When you start the counter, the seconds passed are sent to the localstorage in real time, when you stop the counter, the seconds passed add to the total and when you restart the counter, the count continues from this beginning.
  - When you click on reset button, it's reset the time in the state app & remove time to localStorage ( at each project beginning you can put to 0 the counter)
  - All the cards and their contents are synchronized with the localstorage.
  - The different states of the cards, according to the columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) are also synchronized with the localStorage.
  - You can delete only the project name or you can reset all things in the App (Project name, timer & all cards)
