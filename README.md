# User Guide

## <img  style =" float: left; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 22px " src="demo/backlog.svg" alt="drawing" height="30" width="25"/>My Simple Task Manager_V2.0.0

is a drag-and-drop task manager as well as a time tracker (not for a team, but for a single freelance developer for example)!

### :bookmark: This is a great little application when you are working alone on projects where you need to organize your tasks, as well as track the time you spend on a project to know the actual time you spent on it.

>> - The number of tasks and the average hour per task.

---


**:heavy_exclamation_mark: Time spent on each task!**

![alt text](demo/version2/timeSpent.png "My Simple Tasks Manager")

---

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: Budgetary impact for each task!**

>The second graph represents  the percentage of budget impact for each task (Calculated from the daily rate, the overall time and the time spent on each task individually).

![alt text](demo/version2/budgetImpact.png "My Simple Tasks Manager")

---
**:heavy_exclamation_mark: Number of work sessions per task!**

>This last graph is based on the number of times a task has been put in "In Progress".

![alt text](demo/version2/numberSessionTask.png "My Simple Tasks Manager")

---

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: Further down in the Dashboard page...**

> - You have, first of all, the view on all notes written during the project.
> - Then you have the number of connections to the application.
> - Then come the tasks with their titles, their id, the text description of the task, and the date of creation.

![alt text](demo/version2/secondViewDash.png "My Simple Tasks Manager")

---

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: Then there is the detailed "task/time session" section.**

> - First of all, you have the tasks that required more than 2 hours.
> - Then, the ones that required between 1 hour and 2 hours.

![alt text](demo/version2/thirdViewDash.png "My Simple Tasks Manager")

---

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: Then there is the detailed "task/time session" section.**

![alt text](demo/version2/lastViewDash.png "My Simple Tasks Manager")

## END OF UPDATE New Version
---

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: When you want to delete the Project name!**

>You have two choices, delete only the project name or reset all (Project name, timer & all cards)

![alt text](demo/delete.gif "My Simple Tasks Manager")

---

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: When you want to delete an task card!**

>You have one alert for confirm your wish to delete this card (with name card)

![alt text](demo/confirm-delete-card.gif "My Simple Tasks Manager")

---

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: When you Start the counter!**

>The elapsed seconds are sent to the localstorage in real time, if you close the window inadvertently without stopping the counter, the elapsed time is automatically saved in the localStorage, adding to the time already present (seconds)!

![alt text](demo/real-time-seconds.gif "My Simple Tasks Manager")

---

**:x:** this application is  not responsive on mobile :mobile_phone_off: (as it is an application for people working in front of a computer - developer like me for example - I did not find useful to do media queries for that).


***(The demo is fully functional, all infos are stocked in localStorage)***

- Infos:
  - An input field, at the top right, is made to enter the name of the project you are working on!
  - 1 day of work is equivalent to 8 hours (28800 seconds)! (the calculation of the days worked in proportion to the passed seconds  is made with this logic - each 28800 elapsed seconds increment one day more)
  - When you start the counter, the seconds passed are sent to the localstorage in real time, when you stop the counter, the seconds passed add to the total and when you restart the counter, the count continues from this beginning.
  - When you click on reset button, it's reset the time in the state app & remove time to localStorage ( at each project beginning you can put to 0 the counter)
  - All the cards and their contents are synchronized with the localstorage.
  - The different states of the cards, according to the columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) are also synchronized with the localStorage.
  - You can delete only the project name or you can reset all things in the App (Project name, timer & all cards)
