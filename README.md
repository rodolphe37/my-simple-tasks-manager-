# Tutorial Intro

---

## <img  style =" float: left; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 22px " src="demo/backlog.svg" alt="drawing" height="30" width="25"/>My Simple Task Manager

is a drag-and-drop task manager as well as a time tracker (not for a team, but for a single freelance developer for example)!

### :bookmark: This is a great little application when you are working alone on projects where you need to organize your tasks, as well as track the time you spend on a project to know the actual time you spent on it.

### New Version (19 sept 2021 - ^V_1.7)

---

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: When you are in automatic mode**

## END OF UPDATE New Version

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: When you want to delete the Project name!**

>You have two choices, delete only the project name or reset all (Project name, timer & all cards)

![alt text](demo/delete.gif "My Simple Tasks Manager")

---

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: When you want to delete an task card!**

>You have one alert for confirm your wish to delete this card (with name card)

![alt text](demo/confirm-delete-card.gif "My Simple Tasks Manager")

---

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: When you Start the counter!**

>The elapsed seconds are sent to the localstorage in real time, if you close the window inadvertently without stopping the counter, the elapsed time is automatically saved in the localStorage, adding to the time already present (seconds)!

![alt text](demo/real-time-seconds.gif "My Simple Tasks Manager")

---

**:x:** this application is  not responsive on mobile :mobile_phone_off: (as it is an application for people working in front of a computer - developer like me for example - I did not find useful to do media queries for that).


***(The demo is fully functional, all infos are stocked in localStorage)***

- Infos:
  - An input field, at the top right, is made to enter the name of the project you are working on!
  - 1 day of work is equivalent to 8 hours (28800 seconds)! (the calculation of the days worked in proportion to the passed seconds  is made with this logic - each 28800 elapsed seconds increment one day more)
  - When you start the counter, the seconds passed are sent to the localstorage in real time, when you stop the counter, the seconds passed add to the total and when you restart the counter, the count continues from this beginning.
  - When you click on reset button, it's reset the time in the state app & remove time to localStorage ( at each project beginning you can put to 0 the counter)
  - All the cards and their contents are synchronized with the localstorage.
  - The different states of the cards, according to the columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) are also synchronized with the localStorage.
  - You can delete only the project name or you can reset all things in the App (Project name, timer & all cards)
